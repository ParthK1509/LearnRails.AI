## Problem statement:
### 2. Leverage AI to Analyze Learning and Plan Interventions
Every learner is different‚Äîsome pick up concepts quickly, while others need extra time.
AI can help track learning patterns and suggest ways to improve before frustration kicks
in. How might we use AI to make learning feel more supportive and adaptive? Picture
an AI assistant that notices when a learner struggles with fractions and suggests fun,
interactive exercises to practice before they fall behind.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
