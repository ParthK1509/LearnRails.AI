## Problem statement:
### 2. Leverage AI to Analyze Learning and Plan Interventions
Every learner is different—some pick up concepts quickly, while others need extra time.
AI can help track learning patterns and suggest ways to improve before frustration kicks
in. How might we use AI to make learning feel more supportive and adaptive? Picture
an AI assistant that notices when a learner struggles with fractions and suggests fun,
interactive exercises to practice before they fall behind.

## 📌 Overview  
Every learner is different—some grasp concepts quickly, while others need extra time. **LearnRails.AI** is an AI-powered learning assistant that tracks learning patterns, adapts to user needs, and provides customized learning roadmaps and quizzes. Our goal is to make learning more **supportive, personalized, and engaging**.  

## Our Solution
We have leveraged AI to build a customised roadmap for a learner for learning any topic they need, to make the user feel more supportive through AI, we have added some questions to add personalisation to user specific inputs, we have even created an AI powered quizzing system, in which, our website will ask questions to user according to the familiarity of user to a specific topic, helping the user to build on their weak topics through easier questions and strengthen their strong topics through harder questions. We have also attached hyperlinks to read about a specific topic on the go, so that the user can improve himself on that topic.
This solution to the problem statements ensures that the user get curated roadmaps for learning and curated questions for practicing a topic, making the user’s learning feel more supportive and adaptive.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
